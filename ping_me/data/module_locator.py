"""Locate the data files in the eggs to open."""

# NOTE : This module is redundant now. It was used to locate the csv file
# present inside the installed egg. But as the wheels do not respect relative
# path for data files, using a file may be dangerous and hence the data is
# kept as a dictionary inside `countrylist.py`. The following code is not
# deleted from the package because of love.
